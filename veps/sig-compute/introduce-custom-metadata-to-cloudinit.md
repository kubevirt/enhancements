## Overview
This VEP proposes enhancing KubeVirt's cloud-init metadata support by enabling users to add custom metadata to cloud-init. 
This addresses missing functionality for users to be able to add custom values to the cloud-init metadata.

## Motivation
KubeVirt's cloud-init support previously did not allow users to add custom values to the metadata. 
This prevented users from passing application-specific information to their VMs through cloud-init.
Issue https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/15836 the motivation behind this VEP.

## Goals
- Enable users to add custom metadata fields to cloud-init through the metaData field in both `NoCloud` and `ConfigDrive` configurations
- Implement  `MetaData` in the `CloudInitNoCloudSource` and `CloudInitConfigDriveSource` struct to allow users add custom metadata to the cloud-init
- Implement `MetaDataSecretRef` in the `CloudInitNoCloudSource` and `CloudInitConfigDriveSource` struct to allow users to reference Kubernetes secrets containing custom metadata
- Ensure custom metadata is properly merged with standard metadata fields (instance-id, local-hostname, instance-type, etc.) that KubeVirt automatically generates
- Implement upper limits on the number of metadata entries (16 keys maximum) and value length (256 characters per value) to prevent resource exhaustion

## Non Goals


## Definition of Users
VM owners and workload developers who need to pass custom metadata to their virtual machines 
through cloud-init for application configuration, environment-specific settings, or runtime parameters. 
This includes developers deploying applications that require custom configuration data accessible via cloud-init metadata,
such as environment variables, application settings, or deployment-specific parameters.

## User Stories
- As a VM owner, I want to add custom metadata fields to my cloud-init configuration 
so that my applications can access application-specific configuration data.
- As a VM owner, I want to reference Kubernetes secrets containing
custom metadata so that I can securely pass sensitive configuration data to my VMs.

## Repos
- kubevirt/kubevirt (core API)

## Design
Enhance `CloudInitNoCloudSource` and `CloudInitConfigDriveSource` with `MetaData` field as `map[string]string `and `MetaDataSecretRef` for secret references. 
Secret resolution reads custom metadata and merges with standard fields.

### Entry Limits and Validation
To protect cluster resources and prevent abuse, the following limits will be enforced:

- **Key limit**: Maximum number of custom metadata entries (keys) is **16**
- **Value limit**: Maximum length of each metadata value is **256 characters**
- **Enforcement**: Limits are enforced during API validation, preventing VMI creation if metadata exceeds the thresholds
- **Limit scope**: Limits apply to the combined count of:
  - All key-value pairs in the `metaData` map
  - All key-value pairs from the referenced secret in `metaDataSecretRef`
  - Standard metadata fields generated by KubeVirt are not counted toward the limit

This approach provides resource protection while allowing users flexibility within reasonable bounds. The 16-key limit with 256-character value limit provides sufficient capacity for typical use cases while preventing resource exhaustion.

## API Examples
```yaml
volumes:
- name: cloudinitdisk
  cloudInitNoCloud:
    userData: |
      #cloud-config
      package_update: true
    metaData:
      app_name: "my-application"
      environment: "production"
      cost_center: "12345"
```

```yaml
volumes:
- name: cloudinitdisk
  cloudInitNoCloud:
    userData: |
      #cloud-config
      package_update: true
    metaDataSecretRef:
      name: my-metadata-secret
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-metadata-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  app_name: "my-application"
  environment: "production"
  cost_center: "12345"      
```

## Alternatives

## Scalability
- **Metadata entry limits**: A maximum of 16 keys for custom metadata prevents resource exhaustion from excessively large metadata payloads
- **Value length limits**: A maximum of 256 characters per value ensures individual values remain bounded
- **API validation**: Limits are enforced during API validation, preventing VMI creation if metadata exceeds the thresholds
- **Performance impact**: The 16-key limit with 256-character value limit ensures cloud-init processing remains performant and does not impact VM startup times
- **Resource protection**: Limits protect against both accidental misconfiguration and intentional abuse of the metadata feature

## Update/Rollback Compatibility
- New field is optional; existing VMIs remain unaffected.
- On downgrade, projected volumes fall back to errors or no-op.
## Functional Testing Approach
- Unit tests: API validation, struct marshaling, metadata merging.
- Integration tests: Deploy VM/VMI with custom metadata, verify metadata is accessible in guest.
## Implementation History
- October 17, 2025: Implementation completed and PR submitted.
- October 19, 2025: VEP drafted (after reviewer feedback indicated VEP was required for API changes).
## Graduation Requirements
### GA
**Rationale for direct GA graduation:**
This enhancement introduces a straightforward API addition that extends existing cloud-init functionality with well-defined limits and validation. The implementation includes:
- Simple, additive API changes (`MetaData` and `MetaDataSecretRef` fields)
- Built-in resource protection through entry limits (16 keys maximum, 256 characters per value)
- API validation to enforce limits
- Backward compatible (optional fields, existing VMIs unaffected)

Given the low risk nature of this change, built-in validation mechanisms in place, and the need for this functionality by users, we propose graduating directly to GA without an Alpha phase.

**GA Requirements:**
- Custom metadata support implemented and tested
- MetaData functionality complete with proper validation
- MetaDataSecretRef functionality complete with secret resolution
- Entry limits (16 keys maximum, 256 characters per value) enforced through API validation
- Unit and integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
