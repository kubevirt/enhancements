## Overview

Introduce a centralized capability registry that provides a declarative matrix for expressing feature constraints across hypervisor and architecture combinations. The registry enables validation, test filtering, and clear error messages without duplicating logic across components. 

**Note:** This VEP was extracted from VEP #95 (Hypervisor Abstraction Layer) to allow independent discussion and implementation of the capability registry design. The registry serves as the feature discovery mechanism for the broader hypervisor abstraction framework described in VEP #95. 

## Motivation

- KubeVirt's current architecture-specific validation is scattered across multiple files (`arm64.go`, `s390x.go`), making it difficult to maintain consistency and add new hypervisors.
- Test filtering logic is duplicated throughout the test suite, requiring manual maintenance when features are added or support changes.
- Error messages for unsupported features lack context, documentation links, and version information.
- Adding a new hypervisor requires touching validation logic across multiple components.
- No clear mechanism to declare when features need explicit validation or blocking without creating scattered conditional code.

## Goals

- Provide a mechanism to declare when features require validation or should be blocked on specific platforms.
- Enable automatic validation by querying the capability registry instead of scattered conditional logic.
- Support test filtering so tests only run on compatible infrastructure.
- Generate rich error messages with explanations, documentation links, and version information when features are unsupported.
- Keep the registry focused on features that need explicit controlâ€”not an exhaustive feature catalog.
- Make it simple to add validation points and hypervisor-specific constraints.

## Non Goals

- Create an exhaustive catalog of all KubeVirt features (only register capabilities that need validation, blocking, or special metadata).
- Require registering every feature as a capability (unregistered features are implicitly allowed and handled by normal code paths).

## Definition of Users

- Upstream contributors adding new features or hypervisor support.
- Platform engineers integrating proprietary hypervisor stacks.
- Test infrastructure maintainers ensuring tests run only where features are supported.
- End users receiving clear error messages when requesting unsupported features.

## User Stories

1. As a contributor adding a new hypervisor, I can declare which features need validation or should be blocked, and have validation work automatically without scattered conditional logic.
2. As a test maintainer, I can decorate tests with capability requirements for features that need platform-specific validation and have them automatically skip on unsupported platforms.
3. As an end user, I receive clear error messages with documentation links when I request features that are explicitly unsupported on my platform.
4. As a platform engineer, I can declare constraints (e.g., "VGA unsupported on ARM64") once and have validation, test filtering, and error messages handled automatically.

## Design

### Core Types

```go
// Core types in pkg/capabilities/types.go
type CapabilityKey string  // e.g., "graphics.vga", "firmware.secureboot.uefi"
type SupportLevel int

const (
    Unregistered SupportLevel = iota  // Not registered (default zero value)
    Unsupported                  // Explicitly blocked on this platform
    Experimental                 // Requires feature gate
    Deprecated                   // Supported but discouraged
)

type Capability struct {
    Level       SupportLevel
    Message     string   // User-facing explanation
    Since       string   // Version when constraint registered
    DocLink     string   // Link to documentation
    GatedBy     string   // Optional: feature gate name
}
```

### Capability Definitions

All capabilities are defined once as typed constants in `pkg/capabilities/definitions.go`:

```go
// pkg/capabilities/definitions.go
type CapabilityKey string

// Capability constants - each represents a feature that may need validation or blocking
const (
    CapGraphicsVGA       CapabilityKey = "graphics.vga"
    CapGraphicsVirtIO    CapabilityKey = "graphics.virtio"
    CapSecureBootUEFI    CapabilityKey = "firmware.secureboot.uefi"
    CapCPUHotplug        CapabilityKey = "cpu.hotplug"
    // ... all capabilities declared as constants
)
```

### Registration Pattern

Capabilities are fully defined when hypervisors register their constraints via a builder pattern. The `Capability` struct populated by the builder contains all necessary metadata (level, message, since, docLink, gatedBy).

Hypervisor+architecture combinations register their constraints using a fluent builder API:

```go
// pkg/capabilities/registry.go - Matrix registration with builder pattern
type Capabilities struct {
    matrix map[string]map[CapabilityKey]Capability // "hypervisor/arch" or "hypervisor" -> capabilities
}

type CapabilitiesBuilder struct {
    matrix      *Capabilities
    platformKey string  // Composite key: "hypervisor/arch" or "hypervisor"
}

type CapabilityBuilder struct {
  builder *CapabilitiesBuilder
  cap     CapabilityKey
}

func Register(hypervisor, arch string) *CapabilitiesBuilder {
    // Returns builder for registering capabilities
}

// Fluent methods for registering capability constraints
func (b *CapabilitiesBuilder) Experimental(cap CapabilityKey, gate string) *CapabilitiesBuilder {
    // Mark capability as experimental with feature gate
}

func (b *CapabilitiesBuilder) Unsupported(caps ...CapabilityKey) *CapabilitiesBuilder {
    // Explicitly mark as unsupported (for clarity/documentation)
}

// When richer metadata would otherwise repeat the capability key, `Cap(...)` returns a
// capability-specific builder that keeps the fluent chain focused on a single key.
func (b *CapabilitiesBuilder) Cap(cap CapabilityKey) *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Start capability-specific fluent builder to avoid repeating the key
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) Experimental(gate string) *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Mark capability as experimental with feature gate and continue chaining
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) Unsupported() *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Explicitly mark capability as unsupported and continue chaining metadata helpers
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) WithMessage(msg string) *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Attach custom message while staying on the capability-specific builder
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) WithDocLink(link string) *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Attach documentation link without repeating the capability key
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) WithSince(version string) *CapabilityBuilder {
  // Record the release where constraint was registered without repeating the key
}

func (e *CapabilityBuilder) Done() *CapabilitiesBuilder {
  // Return to the parent builder after finishing metadata customization
}
```

### When to Register Capabilities

The capability registry is **opt-in for validation**. Only register capabilities when you need to:

1. **Block a feature on specific platforms**: Register as `Unsupported` to generate validation errors
   - Example: VGA graphics on ARM64 architectures
   - Example: Certain firmware features on proprietary hypervisors

2. **Mark a feature as experimental**: Register as `Experimental` with a feature gate requirement
   - Example: CPU hotplug while still under development
   - Example: New network multiqueue features

3. **Mark a feature as deprecated**: Register as `Deprecated` to warn users
   - Feature still works but users should migrate away
   - Helps communicate deprecation timeline

4. **Enable test filtering**: Register to control which tests run on which platforms
   - Tests for unsupported features automatically skip
   - Reduces noise in CI for platform-specific features

**What not to register**: Features where support is unknown or still being discovered. If a feature hasn't shown platform-specific issues and doesn't require explicit blocking, leave it unregistered. Let natural test failures and runtime errors reveal compatibility issues, then register capabilities as constraints are discovered. This keeps the registry focused on known validation needs rather than attempting to preemptively catalog all features.

### Registration Examples

Here are examples showing how hypervisors register capability constraints:

```go
// Usage in init() - hypervisor implementations register support:
func init() {
    // Register base KVM constraints (applies to all KVM archs unless overridden)
    Register("kvm", "").  // empty arch = hypervisor-wide default
      Experimental(CapCPUHotplug)
    
    // Architecture-specific constraints for KVM
    Register("kvm", "arm64").
      Cap(CapGraphicsVGA).
        Unsupported().
        WithMessage("VGA graphics not supported on ARM64 architecture").
        WithDocLink("https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/graphics#compatibility").
        Done()
    
    // VGA is unregistered on amd64/s390x - implicitly allowed
}
```

### Resolution Strategy

The registry resolves capabilities using a layered fallback strategy, checking from most specific to least specific:

```go
// Query with automatic fallback: hypervisor/arch -> hypervisor -> base
func Get(hypervisor, arch string, cap CapabilityKey) Capability {
    // Try exact match: kvm/amd64
    if c, ok := lookup(hypervisor+"/"+arch, cap); ok { return c }
    
    // Try hypervisor-wide: kvm
    if c, ok := lookup(hypervisor, cap); ok { return c }
    
    // Not registered - return zero value (caller checks cap.Level)
    return Capability{}
}
```

Resolution precedence (most specific wins):
1. **Hypervisor+Architecture** (e.g., `kvm/amd64`) - most specific
2. **Hypervisor-wide** (e.g., `kvm`) - applies to all architectures unless overridden
3. **Not registered** - returns zero-value `Capability{}` (where `Level` is 0, which equals `Unregistered`)

### Integration Points

#### Validation Webhooks

The validating webhook integrates with the capability registry by:

1. Mapping VMI spec features to capability keys (e.g., `video.type: vga` â†’ `graphics.vga`)
2. Querying the registry for each capability
3. Applying validation logic based on the returned `Capability` data (support level, message, doc links)

The registry provides the data; consumers apply their own validation policy. This pattern replaces scattered validation files (`arm64.go`, `s390x.go`) with centralized data queries.


#### Test Filtering

Tests use capability decorators to automatically skip on unsupported platforms:

```go
// tests/decorators/capabilities.go
var RequiresVGAGraphics = decorators.RequiresCapability(capabilities.CapGraphicsVGA)

It("should support VGA graphics", RequiresVGAGraphics, func() {
    vmi := libvmifact.NewCirros()
    vmi.Spec.Domain.Devices.Video = &v1.Video{Type: "vga"}
})
```

Behavior:
- `Unregistered`: test runs (default for unregistered capabilities)
- `Unsupported`: test skips with message from registry
- `Experimental`: test runs only if feature gate enabled
- `Deprecated`: test runs with warning (feature still works)

Example: VGA tests run on KVM/amd64 (unregistered, implicitly allowed) but skip on KVM/arm64 (registered as unsupported).

#### Node Labeling

The node labeller can optionally expose capability labels on nodes for scheduling and audit purposes:

```go
// Example node labels generated from capability registry (only for registered capabilities)
kubevirt.io/capability.graphics.vga: "unsupported"  // Only on arm64
kubevirt.io/capability.cpu.hotplug: "experimental"
```

This allows users and operators to query node capabilities without inspecting the hypervisor configuration.

### Benefits

- **Opt-in validation**: Only register when validation/blocking is neededâ€”unregistered capabilities allowed by default
- **Centralized constraints**: Single source of truth replaces scattered conditional logic across `arm64.go`, `s390x.go`, etc.
- **Natural inheritance**: Hypervisor-wide constraints with architecture-specific overrides
- **Type-safe**: Constants prevent typos, enable IDE autocomplete
- **Rich error messages**: Automatic user-friendly messages with doc links
- **Automatic test filtering**: Tests skip only when explicitly unsupported

## API Examples

### Querying Capabilities

```go
// Check if a capability has constraints
cap := capabilities.Get("kvm", "amd64", capabilities.CapGraphicsVGA)
if cap.Level == capabilities.Unsupported {
    // Explicitly blocked on this platform
    return fmt.Errorf("%s: %s", capabilities.CapGraphicsVGA, cap.Message)
}
if cap.Level == capabilities.Experimental && !featureGateEnabled(cap.GatedBy) {
    return fmt.Errorf("%s requires feature gate %s", capabilities.CapGraphicsVGA, cap.GatedBy)
}
// Unregistered: allow (normal code paths handle it)

// Get all registered capabilities for a platform (only those explicitly declared)
caps := capabilities.GetAll("kvm", "amd64")
for key, cap := range caps {
    log.Printf("%s: %s (since %s)", key, cap.Level, cap.Since)
}
```

### Error Message Example

```
VGA graphics not supported on ARM64 architecture
Capability: graphics.vga
See: https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/graphics#compatibility
```

## Alternatives

1. **Status quo** â€“ Continue scattered architecture-specific validation files. This increases maintenance burden and makes adding hypervisors difficult.
2. **Per-hypervisor capability files** â€“ Create `pkg/capabilities/hypervisor/kvm/amd64.go` etc. Rejected due to file sprawl and duplication.
3. **Runtime-only discovery** â€“ Query libvirt capabilities at runtime instead of static registry. Rejected because it requires running nodes and can't be used for validation or test planning.

## Scalability

- Capability lookups are constant-time map operations.
- Registry is populated once during init, no runtime registration overhead.
- Memory footprint scales linearly with number of hypervisor+arch+capability combinations (expected to be small).

## Update/Rollback Compatibility

- The capability registry is additiveâ€”coexists with existing validation logic during migration.
- Rolling back removes capability-based validation but doesn't break existing functionality.

## Functional Testing Approach

- Unit tests for capability registry ensuring correct lookup precedence and fallback behavior.
- Integration tests verifying validation webhooks reject unsupported features with correct error messages.
- Integration tests confirming test decorators correctly skip tests on unsupported platforms.
- End-to-end tests covering all support levels (Unregistered, Unsupported, Experimental, Deprecated).

## Implementation History

- 2025-Oct-7: Initial VEP #95 draft.
