# VEP #41: Object Graph API for VM Dependencies

## Release Signoff Checklist

Items marked with (R) are required *prior to targeting to a milestone / release*.

- [x] (R) Enhancement issue created, which links to VEP dir in [kubevirt/enhancements] : https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements/issues/41

## **Overview**

This is a proposal to include an `Object Graph` API in KubeVirt to represent VM and VMI dependencies and their relationships.

## **Motivation**

As new features continue to be added to KubeVirt, the graph of objects related to VMs (DataVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, InstanceTypes, Preferences, Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.) continues to expand. Identifying all the objects that a VM depends on for tasks like backup, disaster recovery, or migration can be error-prone. We should simplify this process for users and partners by creating an authoritative way to retrieve a structured object graph.

## **Goals**

- Introduce a new Object Graph API to represent the list of resources a VM or VMI depends on.
- Expose this API as a subresource of VirtualMachines and VirtualMachineInstances.
- Provide a flexible and extensible data structure.
- Allow for basic filtering (present or future).

## **Non-Goals**

- Reimplementation of existing VM/VMI specs.
- Building a generic Kubernetes-wide graph system.

## **User Stories**

1. As a KubeVirt user, I want a clear way to retrieve all VM and VMI-related dependencies.
2. As a backup partner, I want a way to identify a list of a VM's related objects so I can comprehensively backup and restore everything a VM needs.
3. As a VM owner, I want to easily define an ACM-discovered application and protect my VM with disaster recovery software.
4. As a VM owner, I want to migrate my VM from one cluster to another and identify all necessary dependencies for replication.
5. As a KubeVirt developer, I want a specific place to keep the object graph code updated when I introduce code that changes the relationship of a VM to its dependent objects.

## **Design**

### API Endpoints

```
/apis/subresources.kubevirt.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/virtualmachines/{name}/objectgraph
/apis/subresources.kubevirt.io/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/virtualmachineinstances/{name}/objectgraph
```

### Graph Representation

We propose a **Hierarchical Object Graph** to represent dependencies.
Each object can have child objects, capturing direct relationships between resources (e.g., VM → VMI → Pod → PVC).

#### API Schema

```go
// ObjectGraphNode represents an individual node in the graph.
//
// +k8s:deepcopy-gen:interfaces=k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime.Object
type ObjectGraphNode struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
	ObjectReference k8sv1.TypedObjectReference `json:"objectReference"`
	Labels          map[string]string          `json:"labels,omitempty"`
	// +optional
	Optional *bool `json:"optional,omitempty"`
	// +listType=atomic
	Children []ObjectGraphNode `json:"children,omitempty"`
}

// ObjectGraphOptions holds options for the object graph.
type ObjectGraphOptions struct {
	// IncludeOptionalNodes indicates whether to include optional nodes in the graph.
	// True by default.
	IncludeOptionalNodes *bool `json:"includeOptionalNodes,omitempty"`
	// LabelSelector is used to filter nodes in the graph based on their labels.
	LabelSelector *metav1.LabelSelector `json:"labelSelector,omitempty"`
}
```

##### Example Output
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "objectReference": {
        "apiGroup": "kubevirt.io",
        "kind": "virtualmachineinstances",
        "name": "vm-cirros-source-ocs",
        "namespace": "default"
      },
      "labels": {},
      "optional": false,
      "children": [
        {
          "objectReference": {
            "apiGroup": "",
            "kind": "pods",
            "name": "virt-launcher-vm-cirros-source-ocs-frn9h",
            "namespace": "default"
          },
          "labels": {},
          "optional": false,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "objectReference": {
        "apiGroup": "cdi.kubevirt.io",
        "kind": "datavolumes",
        "name": "cirros-dv-source-ocs",
        "namespace": "default"
      },
      "labels": {
        "type": "storage"
      },
      "optional": false,
      "children": [
        {
          "objectReference": {
            "apiGroup": "",
            "kind": "persistentvolumeclaims",
            "name": "cirros-dv-source-ocs",
            "namespace": "default"
          },
          "labels": {
            "type": "storage"
          },
          "optional": false,
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **User Flow**

1. Access the ObjectGraph API through the subresource endpoint for a VM/VMI.
2. Parse the response and filter unnecessary objects (e.g., in backup scenarios).
3. Use the retrieved data as needed.

### **Included Resources**

#### Kubevirt-native Resources:

The object graph currently tracks core kubevirt and kubernetes resources that are critical to VM lifecycle and behavior, including:

- **Instance type controllerRevision (`status.instancetypeRef.controllerRevisionRef.Name`)**
- **Preference controllerRevision (`status.preferenceRef.controllerRevisionRef.Name`)**
- **VirtualMachineInstance (VMI):** Identified by VM name.  
  - **Virt-launcher Pod:** Identified by label.
  - **Volumes**:
    - **DataVolumes (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].dataVolume`)**
    - **PersistentVolumeClaims (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].persistentVolumeClaim`)**
    - **ConfigMaps (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].configMap`)**
    - **Secrets (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].secret`)**
    - **ServiceAccounts (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].serviceAccount`)**
    - **MemoryDump (`spec.template.spec.volumes[*].memoryDump`)**
  - **AccessCredentials**
    - **SSH Secrets (`spec.template.spec.accessCredentials.sshPublicKey.source.secret`)**
    - **User Password Secrets (`spec.template.spec.accessCredentials.userPassword.source.secret`)**

**Backend Storage PVC**  
Identified by the persistent state PVC label.

**Other Resources:**
- Should optional objects such as `VMExports` or `VMSnapshots` be considered?

#### External Resources

Kubevirt does not own all resources involved in VM operations. Some critical external resources are managed by other components or projects (e.g., Multus, IPAM extensions), but are still essential to VM functionality in operations like backup and restore or cross-cluster live migration.

Examples include network-related resources like **NetworkAttachmentDefinitions** and **IPAMClaims**. These are currently not included in the object graph, primarily to keep kubevirt self-contained. However, in practice, some level of awareness of these resources is necessary to fully support certain VM workflows.

We propose extending the object graph to include selected external resources under well-defined conditions, without importing their dependencies into the core project. Since the object graph is only built when explicitly requested by the user, we believe this is a safe and contained place to introduce support for these additional resources.

To qualify for inclusion, an external resource must meet all of the following criteria:

1. **Relevance**: The resource is directly involved in a kubevirt-supported VM/VMI operation (for example, cross-cluster live migration).

2. **Reference or Ownership**:
   - The resource is explicitly referenced in the VM/VMI spec (such as NADs in `networks[*]`), **or**
   - It is defined or handled by a kubevirt-owned project (such as IPAMClaims from [`kubevirt/ipam-extensions`](https://github.com/kubevirt/ipam-extensions)).

3. **Discoverability**: If the resource is not explicitly referenced in the VM spec or status, there must be a reliable and consistent way to associate it with a VM or VMI. For example, using kubevirt-defined labels, as shown in the [`ipam-extensions` controller logic](https://github.com/kubevirt/ipam-extensions/blob/5030f613e1d1aa372e38946686392989500fb79c/pkg/vminetworkscontroller/vmi_controller.go#L95).

4. **No Direct Dependency**: The resource must be accessed via the **dynamic client** as an unstructured object, avoiding any imports of its external dependencies into the kubevirt codebase. External resources should be included via a generic mechanism, ensuring kubevirt does not need to hardcode knowledge of downstream CRDs.

5. **Limited Scope and Knowledge**: The object graph doesn't need to understand these resources in detail, just need access to their metadata to include them. The inclusion logic must remain isolated to the object graph logic and not affect other parts of the kubevirt codebase.

This approach allows us to build a more complete and useful object graph while clearly defining the boundaries around external dependency inclusion. With filtering options, users can choose whether to include these external resources or stick to core kubevirt objects, ensuring flexibility without imposing the external dependencies.

**Provisional Note:** During the alpha phase, the inclusions mentioned on this field will remain experimental. A generic inclusion mechanism will be introduced to enable referencing external resources without hardcoding knowledge of them. This mechanism may evolve or be replaced before Beta.

##### **Alternatives**

If we decide that external dependencies should never be handled by a kubevirt/kubevirt-owned resource, here are some possible paths forward:

1. Exclude external resources like IPAMClaims from the graph
We could limit the object graph to only core VM-related objects and let integrations handle custom resources separately. If we decide NADs are worth including, this would currently only affect IPAMClaims. This reduces complexity and preserves the self-contained nature of kubevirt.

2. Move the graph to an external repository
This would provide more separation and flexibility, but it represents a departure from the original VEP and would require deprecating the already merged subresource.

3. Allow user-defined or custom extensions in the graph
There could be a mechanism for including additional resources on demand. I'm not sure how feasible is this, but it might offer a compromise between flexibility and maintainability.

## Alternatives Considered

### Flat Dependency List

An alternative was to return a **flat list** of dependent objects without hierarchical relationships.

Example schema:

```go
type ObjectGraphNode struct {
    ObjectReference k8sv1.TypedObjectReference `json:"objectReference"`
    Labels          map[string]string          `json:"labels,omitempty"`
}
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "objectReference": {
        "apiGroup": "kubevirt.io",
        "kind": "VirtualMachineInstance",
        "name": "vm1",
        "namespace": "default"
      }
    },
    {
      "objectReference": {
        "apiGroup": "",
        "kind": "Pod",
        "name": "virt-launcher-vm1",
        "namespace": "default"
      }
    },
    {
      "objectReference": {
        "apiGroup": "cdi.kubevirt.io",
        "kind": "DataVolume",
        "name": "dv1",
        "namespace": "default"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We chose the hierarchical representation because:

- Dependency relationships between objects are meaningful and should be explicit.
- Migration, backup, and restore processes often require processing objects in dependency order.
- Hierarchical graphs allow easier extensibility (for example, marking optional nodes).
- Flat lists can become complex as the number of dependencies grows.

### Other Considerations

1. **Naming:** Is `ObjectGraph` descriptive enough even if we are returning a flat list of objects? Would `DependencyList` be more accurate?
2. **Extensibility:** How can we ensure the API is extensible for future enhancements? Should the API be made more intelligent (with fields such as `Optional`) or just rely on labels for extensibility?
3. **Filtering:** Should the user handle filtering, or should we allow some kind of filtering in the ObjectGraph request?

## **Scalability**

Each ObjectGraph is scoped to a single VM or VMI, reducing overall load. The graph is generated on-demand by the virt-api server.

## **Update/Rollback Compatibility**

- Non-intrusive addition via subresources.
- Safe to introduce and disable per version.
- No changes to existing APIs or objects.
- No changes to existing VM/VMI specs.
  
## **Functional Testing Approach**

- Unit tests to validate graph generation logic
- E2E tests to ensure the API behaves as expected

## **Implementation Phases**

1. Implement ObjectGraph types in the API.
2. Implement virt-api logic to construct and return graphs.
3. Expose endpoints under VM and VMI subresources.
4. Add virtctl integration for user access.

## **Feature Lifecycle Phases**

- **Alpha:**
  - Initial implementation with basic functionality.
  - Introduce a generic inclusion mechanism for external resources, ensuring network resources are handled.
- **Beta:**
  - Evaluate and refine the generic inclusion mechanism.
  - Decide whether NADs and IPAMClaims (or other external resources) should be fully included.
  - Adapt external repos (e.g., Velero plugin) to use the ObjectGraph API.
- **GA:**
  - Improvements based on feedback.
