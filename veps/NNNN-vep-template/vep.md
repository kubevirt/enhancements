## Graduation Requirements

<!--
The requirements for graduating to each stage.
Example:
### Alpha
- [ ] Feature gate guards all code changes
- [ ] Initial implementation supporting only X and Y use-cases

### Beta
- [ ] Implementation supports all X use-cases

It is not necessary to have all the requirements for all stages in the initial VEP.
They can be added later as the feature progresses, and there is more clarity towards its future.
