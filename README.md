# KubeVirt Enhancements Tracking and Backlog

This repository is currently Work In Progress but will eventually be used to manage KubeVirt Enhancement Proposals (VEPs), emphasizing centralized prioritization and enhanced SIG involvement and collaboration.

## Process (DRAFT)

1. **VEP Creation**: VEP authors will initiate proposals via PRs to the `kubevirt/enhancements` repository. [Design proposal template](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/blob/main/design-proposals/proposal-template.md)
2. **SIG Review and Collaboration**: Each VEP will have a target SIG, and the SIG will assign a dedicated reviewer to oversee the proposal, collaborate with other SIGs as needed, and provide feedback or veto when necessary.
3. **Centralized Prioritization**: At the start of each release cycle, all accepted VEPs will be designated as the projectâ€™s priority, focusing community efforts on the associated pull requests. Acceptance will be based on community support and a commitment to implementation.
4. **Visibility and Tracking**: The Author of an accepted VEPs will open an issue to track their progress, maturity stages (alpha, beta, GA), list the associated bugs, and user feedback
5. **Single source of truth**: Each VEP will be the authoritative reference for the associated feature. This aligns with the Kubernetes KEP process. It will ensure that each enhancement
Includes all the relevant information, including the design and the state.

The VEP owner is responsible to update it as its development progresses, until it is fully mature (or deprecated).

## Implementation Phases

1. **Alpha Rollout (v1.5 Cycle)**:
   - [x] Create the `kubevirt/enhancements` repository.
   - [x] Introduce a template for VEP submissions.
   - [ ] Migrate one or two active designs to test the process.
   - [ ] Refine the process based on feedback from initial VEPs.
2. **Full Rollout (v1.6 Cycle)**:
   - [ ] Transition all enhancements to the new process.
   - [ ] Empower SIGs to take increased ownership while maintaining central prioritization.
3. **Future Considerations**:
   - [ ] Gradual reduction in centralized coordination as SIGs become self-sufficient.
